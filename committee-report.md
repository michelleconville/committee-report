##  Chairman’s Foreword

The remit of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters (the Committee) is to consider all disability matters including monitoring Ireland's implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).

The UNCRPD is a landmark Convention, one of history’s most widely adopted conventions, which simply seeks to ensure that people with disabilities can enjoy the same human rights as everyone else. 

A key measure to aid translation of the UNCRPD into law is ensuring adequate funding is allocated in the national budget for the various sectors relevant to the realization of the rights of people with disabilities.Also required is that the human rights of people with disabilities and support for their social inclusion is upheld throughout all further phases of policy development and implementation activities of the State and most importantly that people with disabilities, across all groups, are consulted with throughout these phases.

Therefore, there is a clear need to ensure that overall public expenditure policy, strategy and related reporting aligns with the objectives of the UNCRPD while ensuring funding for a rights-based model of care for disability services over the next 3-5 years.

To ensure that the budget is aligned to realise the rights of all groups of people with disabilities, there needs to be clear commitments to equality proofing of Budgets and the wider Public Duty on Equality and Human Rights must be strongly and visibly reflected in Irelands next Budget with resources to progress implementation of the UNCRPD as a key measure of that.

The Committee believes that the Optional Protocol to the UNCRPD must also be urgently ratified to ensure that the voice that people with disabilities have actively taken under the Convention, and which all sectors of society need to hear, must not be silenced by Ireland not ratifying the Optional Protocol. The mechanisms for delivery of the Optional Protocol must also be funded under Budget 2022.

Currently the rate of poverty and social exclusion for people with disabilities in Ireland is one of the highest in the EU at 38.1% and EU figures show Ireland to be the country with the lowest employment rate of people with disabilities, at 32.3%.

The rise in the poverty rate for people with disabilities was exacerbated by the 2008 financial and economic crisis and subsequent response of austerity, as the consistent poverty rate for people with disabilities was 9% in 20093 and increased significantly to 24% in 2017.

People with disabilities and their families and carers have also been further and signifincatly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic because of the regression caused by the loss of services and their non prioritisation in contingency planning across various sectors.

The implementation of the UNCRPD also includes significant legislative and administrative requirements to be met which will require subsequent funding commitments to ensure timely implementation.

## Optional Protocol to the UNCRPD

The Committee believes that the Optional Protocol to the UNCRPD must be ratified urgently to ensure that complaints can be submitted directly to the UN Committee by individuals if they feel that their rights have been violated under the UNCRPD, and 
for the UN Committee to undertake subsequent inquiries. 

Recommendation

    The Committee recommends that the mechanism for delivery of the Optional Protocol be developed in parallel with the ratification process and that funding be allocated in Budget 2022 in expectation of ratification including resources as may be necessary in absence of ratification, to ensure effective operation of the Optional Protocol when it is ratified in 2022


## General provisions of the Convention

The UNCRPD sets out Universal Design Thinking as a key strategy for the design and development of products, services, ICT and buildings that are accessible and usable to the widest range of users possible regardless of age, size, disability or ability. Universal Design Thinking, as an approach for economic recovery, has greater potential benefits, given it benefits a range of groups including disability groups6 and this will be especially important considering the growth in the ageing population and the longer term challenges for that group. Please refer also to paragraph 9.

Recommendation

    The Committee recommends

    a) developing an economic model based on Universal Design Thinking, as an approach for economic recovery which will develop and sustain a systemic approach to disability budgeting and proofing to ensure alignment with the objectives of the UNCRPD

    b) that Universal Design Thinking is placed at the centre of Government policy development and at local government level to ensure an integrated approach to legislative development which is inclusive of human rights

Ireland must ensure long term change and transition from its reliance on GDP (gross domestic product) as a measure of national economic achievement, which is fuelling short-termism and inequality, and urgently move to a new model of inclusive growth and development,7 in alignment with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Recommendation

    The Committee recommends

    a) new models of inclusive growth and development are considered to ensure that the most vulnerable and people with disabilities are placed at the centre of strategies for the transition from Covid-19, which should be aligned to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

    b) Equality Budgeting and Wellbeing Budgeting are implemented as a matter of urgency and that multi annual funding for specific services that require capacity building is prioritised
