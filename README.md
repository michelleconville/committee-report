## Introduction

1.	The role of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters (the Committee) is to monitor the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  The Committee’s Work Programme 2020/2021 was developed in line with the emerging themes from the UNCRPD.  

2.	Under the theme ‘Health and life’, the Committee heard directly from people with disabilities, families, and Disabled Persons Organisations regarding their experience of the HSE Progressing Disabilities Services Model.  At the Joint Committee on Disability Matters public meeting, 13 May 2021, the HSE extended an invitation to the Committee to visit a Children’s Network Disability Team (CNDT).  In the follow up information from the HSE, the invitation to visit a CNDT was re-iterated.  

## Children’s Network Disability Team (CDNT)

3.	CNDT’s are being established to provide services and supports for all children with complex needs within a defined geographic area by the HSE.  CDNTs are teams of health and social care professionals, including occupational therapy, psychology, nursing, physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, social work, and others. The CNDT will work closely together in a family centred model, focussing on the child’s and family’s own priorities. Once all teams are in place, every child with complex needs will have access to a team, regardless of the nature of their disability, where they live, or the school they attend. 

4.	The Joint Committee are committed to undertaking this visit at this time to gather information on the progress of the rollout of the CNDT and to gain a practical / operational insight into how the model works.   

## Committee Delegation

5.	The visit to the Summerhill Primary Care Centre, Dublin 1 was attended by the following members of the Committee: 
*   Senator Erin McGrehan
*   Senator Mary Seery Kearney

6.	The delegation was accompanied by one member of staff from the Committee Secretariate.

| Challenges                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Solutions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| The immediate challenge is to manage parent expectation whilst the teams become familiar with their new caseload and analyse the support needs of both open and waitlisted children.  There are over 2,500 children on the waiting lists across the 12 teams.                                                                                                                                                                                         | The 12 Children’s Disability Network Managers (CDNMs) are working together to develop a plan for engagement with children who are on waiting lists.  The plan will include targets for contacting all families on the waiting list to identify their priorities and to ensure that pathways that are developed align to these needs.  The plan will include a CHO-wide approach for certain interventions to maximise use of the staff resource.  The CDNMs are also looking at developing a range of resources that may be accessed by families remotely so that they can be directed to them following advice clinics.                                                              |
| Staff recruitment: There are approximately 75 vacancies across the CDNTs and very significant competition to fill posts and recruiting at a time that there are also many new posts in Primary Care.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | The CDNT are reviewing skill mix and competencies required on the team and considering what other disciplines may be able to fulfil these requirements.  As such consideration of nursing and social care posts for certain teams may alleviate pressure on therapists, social work, and psychology.  This is signalled to the Human Resources Department and have requested that available posts are advertised on overseas platforms where appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Accommodation: The vision for CDNTs is that they are situated within a local Community Health Network.  In DNCC there were several Networks that did not have accommodation pre-reconfiguration.  Capacity in some Primary Care Centres is stretched and particularly as they also try to accommodate Enhanced Community Care posts.                                                                                                                  | The CDNT Governance Group established an Infrastructure Sub-Group to review accommodation for the new CDNTs, identify priorities (traffic light) and prepare an Accommodation Register that may be used in planning for next 5 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| New Criteria for CDNTs and Primary Care Services: The new teams are operating to the National Policy on Access for Children and Young People with Disabilities and Developmental Delay.  There is a need to increase awareness and understanding with referrers when to make a referral to Primary Care and when to refer to a CDNT.  There is also a need for alignment between Disability and Primary Care services so that every referral “lands”. | Senior Management in DNCC is driving the roll out of the National Policy on Access.  Phase 1 is looking at how to manage new referrals.  Primary Care are scoping what the new needs for their service will be and what training and resources they may need to respond to these needs.  The CDNMs are running information sessions with Referrers, particularly Primary Care staff, GPs, and Schools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Waitlists transferred to the CDNTs: approximately 3,000 children were transferred to the waiting lists for the CDNTs in Dublin North City and County with some families waiting for more than 5 years for a service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | The CDN Managers have developed a coordinated approach to managing the waiting list to ensure a consistent approach across the CHO.  This includes incremental approach to addressing waiting lists with initial priority for, Children under one year, Children 17+ who require support to transition to adult services and Children waiting over 3 yearsThe CDN Managers are contacting these families to identify immediate priorities and are providing range of response based on identified need.  This may include Individual assessment/intervention if prioritised under the National Prioritisation Policy and Advice Clinics/Group interventions |
